This was an internship challenge-type project where I had to create a better version of the https://www.bygbrewski.com website.

Note: Any text, information, images, and links are not serious, and I redirected most of the links to the home page.

What was used to make this website?

Next.js with TypeScript,
Component library: Ascernity UI,
Animations: Framer Motion,
Routing and Navigation: next/link

What is special about this project and what I have learned?

This website contains carousels, pop-up components, nested carousels & pop-ups, various types of card components, slideshow components, etc.

Apart from styling and animations, I have learned to use useState and useEffect hooks efficiently, mapping all the information, etc.
